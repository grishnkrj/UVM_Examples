# Advanced SPI Controller Specification

## Overview

The Advanced SPI Controller is a highly configurable Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) module that connects to an APB3 bus for register access. It supports master mode operations with multiple configurable features suitable for a wide range of SPI device communications.

SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a synchronous serial communication protocol used for short-distance communication, primarily in embedded systems. This controller implementation provides a feature-rich interface that can communicate with various SPI-compatible devices such as sensors, memory devices, display controllers, and other microcontrollers.

The controller is designed as an APB3 slave peripheral, making it easy to integrate into systems using the AMBA bus architecture. Its comprehensive feature set allows for flexible adaptation to various SPI device requirements without hardware modifications.

## Features

- **APB3 slave interface for register configuration**  
  The controller implements the AMBA APB3 protocol for simple memory-mapped register access. This standardized interface simplifies integration into larger SoC designs and provides a consistent programming model.

- **Master mode SPI operation**  
  Functions as an SPI master, initiating and controlling all bus transactions. The master generates the clock signal and selects the slave devices for communication.

- **Configurable SPI modes (0, 1, 2, 3)**  
  Supports all four standard SPI clock modes defined by combinations of clock polarity (CPOL) and clock phase (CPHA), ensuring compatibility with a wide range of SPI slave devices.

- **Programmable clock divider for flexible SPI clock rates**  
  Allows software to control the SPI clock frequency by dividing the system clock. This enables communication with devices that operate at different speeds.

- **Multiple chip select lines**  
  Supports multiple slave devices on the same SPI bus through individual chip select lines, eliminating the need for external demultiplexers.

- **TX and RX FIFOs for efficient data transfer**  
  Implements First-In-First-Out buffers for both transmit and receive data, allowing for efficient burst transfers and reducing CPU overhead.

- **Interrupt generation for various events**  
  Provides configurable interrupt sources to alert the processor when specific events occur, such as buffer thresholds being crossed or transfer completion.

- **DMA support for high-speed data transfer**  
  Includes direct memory access (DMA) request signals to enable high-speed data transfers with minimal CPU intervention.

- **Configurable data width (4-32 bits)**  
  Supports variable data widths from 4 to 32 bits per transfer, accommodating various device requirements from simple sensors to complex memory devices.

- **LSB/MSB first data transfer support**  
  Configurable bit order allows for compatibility with devices that expect either least-significant bit first or most-significant bit first transmission.

- **Chip select hold capability**  
  Provides an option to keep chip select lines asserted between consecutive transfers, enabling efficient burst transactions with compatible devices.

## Functional Description

### SPI Modes

SPI communication is defined by two key parameters: Clock Polarity (CPOL) and Clock Phase (CPHA), which together determine how data is sampled relative to the clock signal. The controller supports all four standard SPI modes to ensure compatibility with a wide range of devices.

| Mode | CPOL | CPHA | Clock Idle State | Data Sampling Edge | Description |
|------|------|------|-----------------|--------------------|-------------|
| 0    | 0    | 0    | Low             | Rising             | The most common SPI mode. Clock idles low, and data is sampled on the rising edge of the clock. First data bit is presented on MOSI before the first clock edge. |
| 1    | 0    | 1    | Low             | Falling            | Clock idles low, but data is sampled on the falling edge of the clock. First data bit is presented on MOSI at the first rising edge. |
| 2    | 1    | 0    | High            | Falling            | Clock idles high, and data is sampled on the falling edge of the clock. First data bit is presented on MOSI before the first clock edge. |
| 3    | 1    | 1    | High            | Rising             | Clock idles high, and data is sampled on the rising edge of the clock. First data bit is presented on MOSI at the first falling edge. |

The SPI mode is selected by configuring the spi_mode field in the Control Register. Each mode has specific timing characteristics that must match the requirements of the target slave device for proper communication.

### Clock Generation

The SPI clock is derived from the system clock using a programmable divider circuit. This allows the controller to communicate with SPI devices operating at various speeds without requiring changes to the system clock.

The SPI clock frequency is calculated as:
```
spi_clk_freq = system_clk_freq / (2 * clk_div_reg)
```

Where:
- system_clk_freq is the frequency of the system clock (clk input)
- clk_div_reg is the value programmed into the Clock Divider Register
- The factor of 2 accounts for the need to toggle the clock both high and low

For example:
- With a system clock of 100 MHz and a clock divider of 10:
  - spi_clk_freq = 100 MHz / (2 * 10) = 5 MHz
- With a system clock of 100 MHz and a clock divider of 25:
  - spi_clk_freq = 100 MHz / (2 * 25) = 2 MHz

The clock divider should be chosen to ensure the SPI clock frequency does not exceed the maximum supported by the target slave device. Higher clock divider values result in lower SPI clock frequencies.

### Data Transfer

The data transfer process involves several steps coordinated by the controller's internal state machine:

1. **Initialization**: Software configures the controller by:
   - Setting the desired SPI mode (CPOL/CPHA)
   - Programming the clock divider
   - Configuring the data length
   - Setting the chip select behavior
   - Enabling the controller

2. **Data Queueing**: Software writes data to the TX FIFO via the TX_DATA_REG. Multiple writes can be performed to queue up several transfers, up to the FIFO depth.

3. **Transfer Initiation**: When the controller is enabled and the TX FIFO contains data, the transfer state machine automatically initiates a transfer by:
   - Asserting the appropriate chip select line(s)
   - Loading the first data word from the TX FIFO into the shift register
   - Generating the SPI clock according to the configured mode

4. **Data Shifting**: For each bit in the transfer:
   - The controller shifts out one bit on MOSI from the transmit shift register
   - Simultaneously, it shifts in one bit from MISO into the receive shift register
   - The shifting occurs according to the configured SPI mode (CPOL/CPHA)

5. **Transfer Completion**: When all bits have been transferred (as determined by the data_len setting):
   - The received data is pushed into the RX FIFO
   - The chip select line is deasserted (unless cs_hold is set)
   - The controller prepares for the next transfer or returns to idle

6. **Data Reception**: Software reads the received data from the RX FIFO via the RX_DATA_REG. Each read dequeues one data word from the FIFO.

The controller supports full-duplex operation, meaning data is simultaneously transmitted and received. Even when only transmission or reception is of interest, both operations occur. When only transmitting, the received data can be ignored. When only receiving, dummy data (often zeros) should be written to the TX FIFO to generate the clock for the slave device.

### Chip Select Control

Chip select lines are used to select which slave device(s) should respond to the SPI transaction. The controller provides flexible chip select control:

- **Multiple CS Lines**: The controller supports multiple independent chip select lines (determined by the CS_WIDTH parameter), allowing direct control of several slave devices without external demultiplexing.

- **Active Low Signaling**: The chip select lines are active low, meaning they are asserted (active) when driven low and deasserted (inactive) when driven high, following the standard SPI convention.

- **Individual Control**: Each chip select line is controlled by a corresponding bit in the CS_REG register. Setting a bit selects (activates) the corresponding slave device.

- **Broadcast Support**: Multiple bits in the CS_REG can be set simultaneously, allowing the same data to be transmitted to multiple slave devices at once (if the slaves support this mode of operation).

- **Hold Between Transfers**: When the cs_hold bit in the DATA_FMT_REG is set, the chip select lines remain asserted between consecutive transfers. This is useful for burst transfers to devices that support it, such as SPI flash memory devices that require the CS to remain active for the entire multi-byte command sequence.

The chip select lines are automatically managed by the controller based on the CS_REG contents and the cs_hold setting. When the controller is disabled or in the idle state with no pending transfers, all chip select lines are deasserted (driven high).

### Interrupt Generation

The controller can generate interrupts in response to various events to alert the processor when attention is required. This interrupt-driven approach reduces the need for polling and improves system efficiency.

Interrupts can be generated for the following events:

- **TX FIFO Empty**: Indicates that the TX FIFO is empty and needs more data to continue transfers. This can be used to implement a continuous data streaming mechanism where software refills the FIFO whenever this interrupt occurs.

- **TX FIFO Watermark**: Indicates that the TX FIFO level has fallen below the programmed watermark level. This provides an early warning before the FIFO becomes completely empty, allowing software to refill it in a timely manner to maintain uninterrupted transfers.

- **RX FIFO Full**: Indicates that the RX FIFO is full and needs to be read to avoid data loss. This is critical for high-speed transfers where received data must be processed promptly.

- **RX FIFO Watermark**: Indicates that the RX FIFO level has exceeded the programmed watermark level. This allows software to process received data in batches when a sufficient amount has accumulated, without waiting for the FIFO to become completely full.

- **SPI Idle**: Indicates that the SPI controller has completed all pending transfers and returned to the idle state. This can be used to trigger post-transfer processing or to initiate the next batch of transfers.

Each interrupt source can be individually enabled or disabled through the INTR_EN_REG register. When an enabled interrupt condition occurs, the corresponding bit in the INTR_STAT_REG is set, and the irq output signal is asserted.

To handle an interrupt, software should:
1. Read the INTR_STAT_REG to determine which condition(s) triggered the interrupt
2. Take appropriate action (e.g., refill TX FIFO or read RX FIFO)
3. Clear the handled interrupt(s) by writing 1 to the corresponding bit(s) in the INTR_STAT_REG

The controller follows a write-one-to-clear (W1C) mechanism for the interrupt status bits, meaning that writing 1 to a bit clears that interrupt, while writing 0 has no effect. This allows selectively clearing specific interrupts while leaving others pending.

### DMA Operation

For high-speed data transfers with minimal CPU overhead, the controller supports Direct Memory Access (DMA) for both transmit and receive operations.

When DMA is enabled, the controller generates request signals to a DMA controller whenever data needs to be transferred:

- **TX DMA**: When tx_dma_en is set and the TX FIFO has space available, the dma_tx_req signal is asserted. This prompts the DMA controller to transfer data from memory to the TX FIFO. The controller deasserts dma_tx_req when the FIFO becomes full or when the DMA controller acknowledges the request with dma_tx_ack.

- **RX DMA**: When rx_dma_en is set and the RX FIFO has data available, the dma_rx_req signal is asserted. This prompts the DMA controller to transfer data from the RX FIFO to memory. The controller deasserts dma_rx_req when the FIFO becomes empty or when the DMA controller acknowledges the request with dma_rx_ack.

The DMA interface follows a request-acknowledge handshaking protocol, where:
1. The controller asserts the request signal when a transfer is needed
2. The DMA controller performs the transfer and asserts the acknowledge signal
3. The controller deasserts the request signal in response

This handshaking ensures proper coordination between the SPI controller and the DMA controller, preventing data loss or corruption.

DMA operation is particularly beneficial for:
- Large block transfers, such as reading/writing to SPI flash memory
- High-speed continuous data streaming, such as from SPI-based sensors or audio devices
- Applications where CPU availability is limited or needs to be dedicated to other tasks

## Timing Diagrams

### SPI Mode 0 (CPOL=0, CPHA=0)
This timing diagram illustrates the signal relationships for SPI Mode 0, which is the most commonly used mode.

**Key Characteristics of Mode 0:**
- **Clock Idle State (CPOL=0)**: The clock idles at logic low between transfers.
- **Data Sampling (CPHA=0)**: Data is sampled on the rising edge of the clock (transitions from low to high).
- **Data Setup**: The master presents the first bit on MOSI before the first clock edge.
- **Data Hold**: Data bits remain stable during the sampling edge and change on the opposite edge.

**Sequence of Events:**
1. The CS_n line is asserted (driven low) to select the slave device.
2. The master immediately sets up the first data bit (D7) on the MOSI line before the first clock edge.
3. On each rising edge of the clock, the slave samples the MOSI line to receive a bit from the master.
4. Simultaneously, the master samples the MISO line on the same rising edge to receive a bit from the slave.
5. On each falling edge, both master and slave update their output lines (MOSI and MISO respectively) to present the next bit.
6. After all bits are transferred (8 bits in this example), the CS_n line is deasserted unless cs_hold is enabled.
7. The process repeats for subsequent transfers.

**Note**: For other SPI modes (1, 2, and 3), the relationship between clock polarity/phase and data sampling changes according to the CPOL and CPHA settings as described in the SPI Modes section.

## Error Handling

The controller implements several error handling mechanisms to ensure robust operation:

- **APB Errors (apb_pslverr)**:
  - Generated for accesses to invalid register addresses
  - Generated for write accesses to read-only registers
  - Generated for read accesses to write-only registers
  - When an error occurs, the apb_pslverr signal is asserted during the APB transfer, allowing the master to detect the error condition
  - The transfer still completes, but no side effects occur for invalid operations

- **TX FIFO Overflow Protection**:
  - Writes to the TX Data Register when the TX FIFO is full are silently ignored
  - The tx_full status flag provides an indication that the FIFO is full
  - Software should check this flag or use the TX FIFO Level Register before attempting to write data
  - No data corruption occurs if overflow is attempted

- **RX FIFO Underflow Handling**:
  - Reads from the RX Data Register when the RX FIFO is empty return a value of zero
  - The rx_empty status flag provides an indication that the FIFO is empty
  - Software should check this flag or use the RX FIFO Level Register before attempting to read data
  - No corruption of other registers occurs if underflow is attempted

- **Transfer State Protection**:
  - The controller prevents starting new transfers when disabled
  - Internal state machines ensure proper sequencing of operations
  - If the controller is disabled during an active transfer, the transfer completes safely before the controller enters the idle state

- **Reset Recovery**:
  - The synchronous reset (rst_n) initializes all registers to known states
  - FIFOs are cleared and pointers reset
  - The controller returns to a known good state after reset assertion

These mechanisms ensure that the controller can recover from error conditions and continue operation without requiring system reboot or special recovery sequences.

## Power Management

The controller includes features to minimize power consumption when not actively transferring data:

- **SPI Clock Gating**:
  - The SPI clock is only generated during active transfers
  - Between transfers or when the controller is disabled, the clock output remains static at its idle level (based on the CPOL setting)
  - This reduces dynamic power consumption in both the controller and connected slave devices

- **Controller Disable**:
  - When the enable bit in the Control Register is cleared, the controller enters a low-power state:
    - No SPI clock is generated
    - Chip select lines are deasserted
    - Internal state machines remain idle
    - Only register access through the APB interface remains active
  - This provides a software-controlled method to reduce power consumption when the SPI interface is not needed

- **Clock Divider**:
  - The programmable clock divider allows reducing the SPI clock frequency to the minimum required for communication
  - Lower clock frequencies result in reduced dynamic power consumption
  - The clock divider can be adjusted dynamically based on performance and power requirements

These features allow system software to balance performance and power consumption based on the current operational needs.

## Integration Guidelines

To properly integrate the Advanced SPI Controller into a larger system design, follow these guidelines:

- **Clock and Reset**:
  - Connect a stable system clock to the clk input
  - The clock frequency should be at least twice the desired maximum SPI clock frequency
  - Connect an active-low reset signal to rst_n, typically derived from the system reset
  - Ensure proper reset synchronization if the system reset is asynchronous

- **APB Interface**:
  - Connect the APB signals to the system's APB bus
  - Ensure proper address decoding for the controller's register space
  - The APB address space allocated to the controller should be at least 0x030 bytes (12 registers × 4 bytes each)
  - Configure the APB bridge to handle the ready signal (apb_pready) for variable-latency transfers
  - Implement error handling for the slave error signal (apb_pslverr)

- **SPI Interface**:
  - Route the SPI signals (spi_clk, spi_cs_n, spi_mosi, spi_miso) to the appropriate package pins
  - Consider adding series termination resistors on output pins for signal integrity
  - For high-speed operation, ensure proper impedance matching and signal integrity
  - If connecting to multiple slaves, ensure all slaves share the clock and data lines properly
  - For long PCB traces, consider adding pull-up resistors on the MISO line to prevent floating inputs

- **Interrupt Handling**:
  - Connect the irq output to the system's interrupt controller
  - Configure the interrupt controller to trigger on the rising edge or high level of the irq signal
  - Implement an interrupt service routine that handles all enabled interrupt conditions
  - Clear interrupt status bits after handling to prevent interrupt storms

- **DMA Integration**:
  - Connect the DMA request/acknowledge signals to a compatible DMA controller
  - Configure the DMA controller for memory-to-peripheral (TX) and peripheral-to-memory (RX) transfers
  - Set up appropriate DMA channels with the correct addressing modes and transfer sizes
  - For optimal performance, configure the DMA to transfer multiple words at a time based on FIFO thresholds

- **Power Management**:
  - Consider gating the clock to the entire controller when it is not in use for extended periods
  - Implement software routines to disable the controller when not needed
  - For low-power systems, consider implementing a power domain that can be shut down when SPI communication is not required

- **Testing and Validation**:
  - Verify timing requirements of connected SPI devices
  - Test all four SPI modes if multiple device types will be used
  - Validate proper operation at both minimum and maximum expected clock frequencies
  - Verify proper interrupt and DMA operation under various load conditions
  - Test error recovery mechanisms by deliberately causing overflow/underflow conditions

Following these guidelines will ensure proper operation of the Advanced SPI Controller within the larger system while maximizing performance and reliability.
