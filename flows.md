## Verification Planning Phase

### 1. Requirements Analysis
- Review design specifications and RTL implementation
- Identify functional requirements, interfaces, and operational modes
- Document corner cases, boundary conditions, and potential bugs
- Hold requirement walkthrough meetings with design team

### 2. Verification Plan Development
- Create verification plan document (usually in spreadsheet/document form)
- Define coverage targets:
  - Feature coverage
  - Code coverage targets (line, toggle, FSM, branch, expression)
  - Functional coverage points
- Document verification strategy for each feature
- Define pass/fail criteria for verification closure

### 3. Verification Environment Architecture
- Create high-level block diagram of verification environment
- Identify agents, monitors, and interfaces needed
- Plan sequences and test cases based on requirements
- Document assumptions and constraints

### 4. Timeline and Resource Allocation
- Break down verification tasks and estimate effort
- Allocate resources based on complexity
- Define milestones and deliverables
- Establish project schedule and dependencies

## Testbench Architecture Phase

### 1. Interface Definition
- Create SystemVerilog interfaces for all DUT connections
- Define clocking blocks for synchronization
- Add assertion properties for protocol checking
- Document signal timing requirements

### 2. Transaction Model Development
- Define transaction/sequence items for each interface
- Implement randomization constraints
- Create utility functions for transaction manipulation
- Develop transaction scoreboarding and comparison methods

### 3. Environment Class Structure
- Create environment architecture based on verification plan

  1. Interfaces and sequence items
  2. Drivers and monitors
  3. Sequencers and sequences
  4. Agents
  5. Scoreboard and checkers
  6. Environment
  7. Tests
- Create register model using UVM-REG if needed
- Implement coverage collectors

### 2. Component Unit Testing
- Test each component individually using simple test cases

- Debug component issues in isolation
- Document unit test results

### 3. Integration and System Testing

### 4. Code Reviews and Quality Control
- Conduct peer reviews for all verification code
- Verify compliance with coding standards
- Check for reuse opportunities
- Validate randomization constraints and coverage
- Ensure proper error handling and reporting

## Regression and Coverage Phase

### 1. Regression Framework Setup
- Establish regression test suite
- Configure test prioritization:
  - Smoke tests (basic functionality)
  - Sanity tests (must-pass features)
  - Full regression (comprehensive)
- Define seed management for randomization
- Set up automated regression infrastructure

### 2. Coverage Collection and Analysis
- Configure coverage collection:
  - Code coverage
  - Functional coverage
  - Assertion coverage
- Establish coverage database management
- Set up automated coverage reports
- Define coverage review process

### 3. Regression Execution
- Run nightly/weekly regressions
- Track pass/fail rates
- Debug failing tests
- Update tests based on failures
- Document regression results

### 4. Coverage Closure
- Analyze coverage holes
- Create targeted tests for coverage gaps
- Track coverage metrics over time
- Conduct coverage review meetings
- Document coverage closure activities

## Signoff Phase

### 1. Verification Closure Review
- Verify all requirements have been tested
- Confirm all coverage targets met
- Review all open issues and bugs
- Check all assertions have passed
- Verify all tests passing consistently

### 2. Formal Documentation
- Create final verification report
- Document coverage results
- List known limitations
- Provide recommendations for future verification
- Archive verification environment and results

### 3. Handoff to Integration Team
- Package IP for integration
- Document integration requirements
- Provide test vectors for higher-level testing
- Transfer knowledge to SoC/system team
- Support integration issues

### 4. Post-Mortem Analysis
- Review verification process effectiveness
- Document lessons learned
- Identify process improvements
- Update verification methodology
- Archive best practices for future projects
